# Advanced approval

The module `sv-approval-advanced` is an extension to the [Approval process automation][1] extension.
This module provides multiple levels of approval instead of the 2 levels of said extension.

The additions made in this module were initially [submitted][2] as improvements to the original module,
but until they are merged we wanted everybody to be able to use it already.
If there is a lot of interest we can provide an update of this module that also does the migration of the old approval rules.

## Installation

Place this in the `extensions` folder of your iTop instance and run iTop setup again.
Be sure to enable the extension during setup.
